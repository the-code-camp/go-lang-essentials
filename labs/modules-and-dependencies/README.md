## Modules

- [Using Go modules](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules)
- [New module changes](https://go.dev/blog/go116-module-changes)

A module is a collection of Go packages stored in a file tree with a `go.mod` file at its root. The `go.mod` file defines the module’s module path, which is also the `import` path used for the root directory, and its dependency requirements, which are the other modules needed for a successful build. Each dependency requirement is written as a module path and a specific semantic version.

Before Go 1.13, Go forced us to keep the source inside `$GOPATH/src` folder. With `Go modules` this is not required any more and we can keep the source folder anywhere in the file system.

Let's create a folder named as `module-examples` in your workspace and create a file `main.go` inside it.

`module-examples\main.go`:

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "utils"

func main() {
  result := utils.Sum(10, 20)
  fmt.Println("Result is: ", result)
}
```

`module-examples\utils\myutils.go`:

```go
func Sum(a int, b int) int {
  return a + b
}
```

Compile and run the program from the command line and check the error message:

```shell
$ go run main.go

main.go:4:8: cannot find package "utils" in any of:
  /usr/lib64/golang/src/utils (from $GOROOT)
  /home/ashish/go/src/utils (from $GOPATH)
```

To fix, we need to create a go module inside our `module-examples` folder. 

```shell
go mod init learning-modules
```

Make the following changes to `main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "learning-modules/utils"
)

func main() {
  result := utils.Sum(10, 20)
  fmt.Println("Result is: ", result)
}
```

Run again:

```shell
$ go run main.go

Result is:  30
```

## Module name

When initializing module name using `go mod init <MODULE-NAME>`. The module name can be anything but generally it is named after the place where the source is kept. You will see references of `github.com` at several places and it is a standard practice but not mandatory.
For e.g. the module can be named as:

```shell
go mod init github.com/the-code-camp/go-lang-essentials
```

## External dependencies

When your code uses external packages, those packages (distributed as modules) become dependencies. Using Go modules you can add new dependencies and manage the existing ones. Over time, you may need to upgrade them or replace them. Go provides dependency management tools that help you keep your Go applications secure as you incorporate external dependencies.

To add an external dependency of `gorilla/mux` to your project run the below command:

```shell
$ go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux

# now check go.mod file
$ cat go.mod
```
