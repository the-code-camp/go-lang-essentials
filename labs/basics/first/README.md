## Introduction to Go
ðŸ“‹ Write you first Go program. 
- Create a folder named `learning-go` inside your home folder.
- This folder will be used to keep all the go programs we will create while learning.
- Open your favourite IDE and point it to the folder you just created.
- Name your file as `main.go`

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello World!!")
}
```

## Running your first program
open terminal and change your directory to the go source folder you created for storing your files.

```shell
#run the below command where you have your main.go file
go run main.go
```
## Explore the go cli
```shell
#just write go on command line and press enter
go
```
