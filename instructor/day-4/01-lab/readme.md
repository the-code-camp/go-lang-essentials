# Exercise: Student Management System

### Create a program to manage students using pointers in Go. This program should have the following features:
- Implement functions/methods to:
  - Add a new student to a list (slice) of students.
  - Display all students and their details.
  - Update student details by name.
  - Delete a student by name.

- Utilize pointers to manipulate the student records.

- You need to complete the methods `AddStudent`, `DisplayStudents`, `UpdateStudent`, and `DeleteStudent` to make this program fully functional. Use pointers wherever necessary to efficiently manipulate the student records.
